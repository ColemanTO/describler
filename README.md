# Describler

Describler is an experimental screen reader (audio browser for blind people) for SVG, and specifically SVG data visualizations.

Describler also has an online editing tool that helps you to make your SVG images accessible and reusable. It shows you all of the text content of your SVG in an editable list, including both visible text and metadata, and makes it easy for you to add descriptive content, or change the text that's already there. And you can use the “audio preview” feature to hear how your SVG sounds in common screenreaders. The Describler editor also makes your SVG auto-scaling by default, rather than a fixed size; this allows you to use your SVG at whatever size you need, or to change the size dynamically, and it allows users to zoom and pan easily.
